        Readme for F2CBLASLAPACK
        

=============
General Info:
============

This directory contains the BLAS and LAPACK routines converted to C
using f2c and then manually cleaned up to NOT require any special f2c
libraries.  This is provided for two reasons

1) to allow PETSc to be completely built with full functionality
   without a Fortran compiler
2) to allow automatic differentiation tools for C to be used on all of
   PETSc.

Note:

The F2CBLASLAPACK does not have complex functions. If these are
required, the FBLASLAPACK package should be used.

=========================
Installation Instructions:
=========================

The libraries can be compiled 2 ways:

1. Using PETSc makefiles (default)
This way, the compiler and other information that is required to
compile, and build the libraries is picked up from the PETSc
makefiles. 

For eg:, to build on solaris, one can use:
make PETSC_ARCH=solaris PETSC_DIR=/home/user/petsc

2. Specify all the makefile variables.

This can be done by editing the makefile, specifying the compiler,
options, and other required make variables. Also comment out the make
include statement.

To build the libraries, the following command can now be used:
make 

=================
Additional Notes:
=================

If building the blas and lapack libraries for more than one
architecture or for two different compilers, we recommend moving the
libraries to a sub directory that indicates they are associated with a
particular OS/compiler. For example after making the libraries for solaris,
mkdir solaris
mv libf2cblas.a solaris/
mv libf2clapack.a solaris/

On windows machines, cygnus tools are required to build the libraries,
along with win32fe - the PETSc frontend to Microsoft/Intel/Borland
compilers.  For additional info, check the PETSc installation
instructions.
